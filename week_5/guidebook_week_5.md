### Let's build a backend system using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for our "CRM System For People" app


In the previous activity, we built a basic but functional front-end application for a project called "CRM System For People". And we have built it in a way so that it can be easily integrated with a backend system, In other words, minimizing hard coding.

Notice that we started with a basic website in the first week, then we looked into some useful open sources packages that we can use to build a full stack application.

The main programming language we are relying on is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

The reason why we chose NestJS instead of Express.js is due to the following reasons:
- It uses TypeScript by default, just like Angular, meaning you'll be able to find bugs early
- It has a powerful CLI that helps in writing boilerplate code
- It has almost everything we need to build a backend system for the business requirement we have
- It uses the same structure as Angular
- And it is based on Express.js ðŸ˜Ž

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity you will learn the following:

- Learn how to install NestJS CLI
- Learn how to use NestJS documentation guide
- Learn how to use NestJS CLI to add a resource
- Use TypeORM to define our objects (Case, Organization, User)
- Use Swagger to provide documentation for our API
- Use the API explorer provided by Swagger
- Use express session with redis to store user sessions
- Setup user authentication and authorization


### Notes

#### Organization Entity
Properties: 
- id, number, ID Property auto-generated
- companyName, string, required
- companyLogo, string, required
- active, boolean, required


#### Case
Properties: 
- id, number, ID Property auto-generated
- caseType, enum(CaseType), required
- caseStatus, enum(caseStatus), required
- content, string, required
- organization, number, required
- user, number, required

#### Case Status Enum
```typescript
enum CaseStatus {
  IN_PROGRESS = 'IN_PROGRESS',
  ON_HOLD = 'ON_HOLD',
  RESOLVED = 'RESOLVED',
  CANCELED = 'CANCELED'
}
```

#### Case Type Enum
```typescript
enum CaseType {
  INQUIRY = 'INQUIRY',
  COMPLAIN = 'COMPLAIN',
  COMPLIMENT = 'COMPLIMENT'
}
```


### Getting Started with NestJS

Documentation here: https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview


Follow the steps below.

```bash
# install nestJS CLI


npm install -g @nestjs/cli

# to scaffold a new nest app, enter the following command:
nest new

# it will ask you to name the project. call it:
crmforpeople-app

# it will ask which package manager to use. Select NPM
npm


# You can now change the directory and start the app


# change directory
cd crmforpeople-app

# start the app
npm run start


# install required packages
# https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database
# https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction

npm i --save @nestjs/typeorm typeorm mysql2
npm i class-transformer class-validator
npm i redis express-session connect-redis
npm i -D @types/express-session

# create case resource
nest g resource case

# ? Would you like to generate CRUD entry points? Yes

# create organization resource
nest g resource organization

# ? What transport layer do you use? REST API
# ? Would you like to generate CRUD entry points? Yes

# create user resource
